# Project Feedback + Evaluation

Your feedback is based on the [Evaluation Rubric](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-exercises/project2/blob/master/evaluation.md) provided for this project. If you have any questions about your score or the feedback provided below, please don't hesitate to reach out!

## Technical Requirements:

> Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

Your Score: 2
	
**Comments:**
Great work! You met all of the technical requirements!

If you would like to bring this up to a 3: Excelling, one thing you could look in to is using something like [Paperclip](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip) to implement image uploads for your recipes.

Additionally, You should consider adding validation to your user authentication. I was able to create a username/password with `email@email.com` and `123456`. This is pretty simple to do with Devise and you can do the validation in Rails and/or in JavaScript.

## Creativity/Interface:

> Is your user interface easy to use and understand? Does it make sense for the problem you're solving? Does your interface demonstrate creative design?

Your Score: 1

**Comments:**
You're off to a good start, you just need to spend a little more time with the styling before the Student Spotlight. A couple of specific things you could implement are styling for headers and links, custom styling for your forms as well as error and flash messages.

Don't feel like you have to come up with this stuff by yourself!  We do *NOT* expect students to be designers. But at the very least, you should be applying styling to all the headers, links and forms rather than leaving the default browser styling.

An easy way to do this is to look at applications that you use often and/or you know are well designed (Facebook, Airbnb, GitHub) and mimic their styling and design to get you started. You can also look at something like [Codepen Patterns](https://codepen.io/patterns/) or  [Collect UI](http://collectui.com/) for ideas and inspiration.

## Code Quality:

> Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code?

Your Score: 2

**Comments:**
Your code is missing comments and documentation but is otherwise well organized and clean. It looks like you were able to leverage many of Rails' built-in helpers to clean up your code.

Any code you've commented out should just be deleted. Developers will often comment out code as a way of "saving it for later" but that is what Git is for! This just makes your code messy and leaves 'dead code' that your coworkers or teammates will have to sort through.


## Functionality:

> Does the scope of functionality you've built meet the minimum requirements? Do the core components of your application work without errors?

Your Score: 2

**Comments:**
You've implemented CRUD on Recipes and Ingredients and added the ability to favorite a recipe.You've also implemented authentication with devise. All of this without any errors. Great work!

It looks like you've started implementing user profiles and I think you mentioned implementing categories for recipes - both of those would be great bonus features to add! As would user uploaded images mentioned above.


## Planning / Process / Submission:

> Is there clear evidence of planning? Is there adequate documentation?

Your Score: 2

**Comments:**
Your ERD looks great. Also really great to see you using GitHub projects to manage your user stories. Your Git Log looks pretty good, though I'll always recommend committing more often!
