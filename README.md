# home-baked-recipes
_Description_: Home Baked Recipes app is written in HTML, CSS, Ruby and Rails

_App Objective_: Share recipes online with other people.  Each user has their own log
in and can upload and manage their recipes.

_Technologies Used_: The framework of the app is build using Rails.  Ruby, HTML, and CSS are
used to add functionality and style to the app.

_Unresolved Issues_: The CSS could look better and there are a couple of elements that could
be hidden until the user has logged in.

_Hosted Project URL_: (https://home-baked-recipes.herokuapp.com/)

_Ongoing Plans_:  I plan on fixing the unresolved issues and adding a user profile section
where users can add a bio and view all of their recipes and favorited ones.  If the app gets
bigger I may add categories and a search feature.
